# STM_SimpleSchedulerBasedCalculator

This repository provides a simple calculator scheduler based on the STM32F041CC microcontroller, with implementations of the switch driver (including debouncing handling ), keypad driver, and 4-wire LCD communication driver. The application and module are handled through a simple implementation of an OS scheduler that manages application functionality through tasks. The keypad driver debounces input, providing reliable and responsive input, while the LCD communication driver supports efficient and reliable communication with 4-wire LCDs. With this repository, you can quickly and easily add calculator and scheduling functionality to your STM32F041CC-based projects, with reliable input and output handling.
